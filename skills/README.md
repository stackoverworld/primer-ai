# Skills Catalog

Keep this catalog small and high-signal. Each skill must include:
- `SKILL.md` with clear trigger conditions
- `tests/trigger-cases.md` with under-trigger and over-trigger examples

Included starter skills:
- `architecture-update`: contract/boundary change workflow
- `adaptive-refactor`: stack-aware safe refactor loop with deterministic checks

Run `node scripts/check-skills.mjs` after adding or editing skills.
