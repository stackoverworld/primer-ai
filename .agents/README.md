# AGENTS Fragments

Root `AGENTS.md` is composed from `.agents/fragments/root/*.md` to keep high-level instructions maintainable.

## Commands
- Compose and write root file: `node scripts/compose-agents.mjs --write`
- Validate composition only: `node scripts/compose-agents.mjs --check`

Use fragments for durable sections and keep subtree-specific guidance in scoped `AGENTS.md` files.
