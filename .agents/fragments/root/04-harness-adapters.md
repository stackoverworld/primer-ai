## Harness Adapters
- Codex chain behavior: root `AGENTS.md` + deeper scoped files are intentionally concise to avoid context truncation.
- Claude-specific adapter files are omitted because Claude target was not selected.
- Cursor adapters were skipped in this initialization.
- Architecture draft source: codex output normalized into deterministic templates.
