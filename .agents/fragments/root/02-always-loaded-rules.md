## Always-Loaded Rules
- Treat this file as the routing layer, not the full handbook.
- Pull detailed guidance from `docs/index.md` before major design changes.
- Keep edits scoped; avoid unrelated cleanup unless explicitly requested.
- Prefer deterministic checks over prose-only guidance.
- Update docs when architecture or contracts change.
- Keep responses concise, concrete, and verifiable.
- Prefer invoking project automation over manual style enforcement.
