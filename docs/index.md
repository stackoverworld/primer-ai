- `architecture.md`: architectural boundaries, module ownership, and dependency rules.
- `api-contracts.md`: contract-first API design, versioning, and compatibility.
- `conventions.md`: coding standards, testing expectations, and collaboration flow.
- `maintenance.md`: mechanical checks, context budget enforcement, and automation policy.
- `skills.md`: curated skill inventory and trigger/testing lifecycle.
- `decisions/`: ADR history for architectural tradeoffs.
- `runbooks/local-dev.md`: local setup, run, and troubleshooting steps.
